# VoiceAuthenticationUI
This project serves as a POC for my internship at Fidelity International during summer 2017, for using voice a metric for authentication, in simple words, granting or denying access by identifying whether or not the user is authentic. 
This is just the client side code which is the core part of user interface build using android dev.
Server was running on Eclipse, the communication between the client side code and server side code was done using Restful APIs and Spring Framework. Microsoft Cognitive services were used to match the voice print.
